      <description>Many a times you wake up and realize that today you will be traversing through an array or maybe many arrays. But you don&#39;t worry about it, you have done it before and it wasn&#39;t that difficult. You also have a lot of options, you can use the good old loops, or the wonderful map, reduce, fitler. OR you can use the iterators.
Iterator is a design pattern that allows us to traverse over a list or collection.</description>

      <description>reduce() is an absolute beast of a method when it comes to functional style programming in JavaScript. The more you use it, the more you see use cases popping everywhere for it.
I recently realized, that it has become my goto method, whenever I have to deal with arrays. So I looked through bunch of my code and found a lot of examples, some of which I will list in this post.</description>
